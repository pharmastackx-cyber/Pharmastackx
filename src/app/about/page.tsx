            PharmaStackX is building the essential digital infrastructure required for modern healthcare in Africa. 
            Our core mission is to end the devastating public health problem caused by inventory invisibility. 
            When a patient needs life-saving medication, they should never be turned away. We achieve this by 
            transforming every local community pharmacy into a node of a real-time fulfillment network.

            The challenge is not a lack of medicine; it is a lack of information. Patients, doctors, and hospitals 
            suffer devastating delays when they cannot confirm stock levels, who has the medication? How far is it 
            from me? This stock-out gap is a logistical crisis that leads to wasted time, lost revenue for pharmacists, 
            and poor patient outcomes.
